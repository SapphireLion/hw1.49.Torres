### Critique

- **Circles**: Which button corresponds to which floor? (Disconnected numbers)
- **Basic Design**: Black and White design is rather plain.
- **Uneducated be Damned**: What is the difference between the Bell button and the HELP button? Who does HELP call?
- **Positives**: Braile on numbering aids the blind.
