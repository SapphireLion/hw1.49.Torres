### Critique

- **Circles**: Which button corresponds to which floor? (Disconnected numbers)
- **Basic Design**: Black and White design is rather plain.
- **Uneducated be Damned**: What is the difference between the Bell button and the HELP button? Who does HELP call?
- **Positives**: Braile on numbering aids the blind.

## Rally Point Bravo - Functionality Review
### Uses for an Elevator Control Panel:
- **Go Up and Down** - Yes, but the display could be a bit more clear.
- **Emergency Services** - Yes, but they are vague
- **Services for Disabled** - Yes, Braile, but it could be more visible.
- **Wrong Floor Cancel** - No
- **Current Weight on Elevator** - No
- **Current Floor Display** - No

### Common Use Cases
- **Use Case 1: User Enters Elevator**

User enters elevator, reads display, selects floor they wish to travel towards, then waits for elevator doors to close, then travels to corresponding floor

- **Use Case 2: Emergency**

User has emergency occur during elevator travel, uses emergency button

### Potential Errors

Some potential errors could occur if:
- The user is blind and mis-reads the Braile due to the lettering being too small.
- The user accidentally picks to wrong floor due to matching wrong circle to wrong floor number.
- The user presses the wrong button during an emergency.
- The user misjudges their weight and enters an elevator that is too heavy for them to ride on.
- The user does not know what floor they are currently on and picks the wrong floor to go to as a result.
